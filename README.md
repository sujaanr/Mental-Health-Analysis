# Analyze Students' Mental Health
This project is inspired by a significant study conducted by a Japanese university in 2018, which highlighted the mental health challenges faced by international students. Approved by numerous ethical and regulatory boards, the study's findings, published in 2019, revealed a heightened risk of mental health issues among international students compared to their domestic counterparts. Factors such as social connectedness and acculturative stress were identified as key predictors of depression among this demographic.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the students dataset using SQL and Python to investigate the mental health of international students. Specifically, we aim to validate the findings of the 2019 study and explore whether the duration of an international student's stay in the host country influences their mental well-being.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation

- Secure access to a comprehensive `students` dataset that includes information on student demographics, duration of stay in the host country, social engagement levels, and mental health assessments.

### Data Analysis

- Use SQL for data querying and management tasks, focusing on extracting relevant subsets of data, such as international students' records.
- Apply Python for statistical analysis and data visualization to identify patterns and correlations between the length of stay, social connectedness, acculturative stress, and mental health outcomes.

### Key Metrics

- **Social connectedness:** Measured by the number of social groups or communities the student is actively involved in.
- **Acculturative stress:** Assessed through a standardized questionnaire.
- **Mental health status:** Evaluated using validated psychological scales for depression, anxiety, and overall well-being.

### Expected Outcomes

- To confirm or refute the higher prevalence of mental health difficulties among international students as reported in the 2019 study.
- To determine the impact of the length of stay on students' mental health, offering insights into whether longer stays exacerbate or alleviate mental health issues.

# Significance
Understanding the mental health impact of studying abroad is crucial for developing supportive policies and programs that foster a positive academic and social environment for international students. By exploring the role of the duration of stay, this project seeks to contribute valuable insights into how educational institutions and policymakers can better support the mental well-being of this vulnerable student population.

# Conclusion
This project represents a crucial step towards recognizing and addressing the unique challenges faced by international students. Through a detailed analysis of the students dataset, we aim to shed light on the factors contributing to their mental health and propose actionable strategies to enhance their university experience.
